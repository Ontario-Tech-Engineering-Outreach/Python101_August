# Another thing that makes computer programs so powerful is that they can perform calculations
# On anything the user gives it!

# The way we get the user to give us something in python is by using the input() function
print("Type something")
myInput = input() # We say a variable is equal to our input, and whatever the user types in, will become the value of the variable
print("You typed in: " + myInput)

# You can also give the input a prompt like
myInput = input("What is your name?: ")
print("Hello " + myInput + "!")
