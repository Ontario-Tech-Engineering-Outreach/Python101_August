# In computer programming, outputs are important because it lets the computer tell us
# what it's thinking.

# One way that we get the computer to give us an output is by using the print() function
print("Hello World!")

# This function takes whatever is in the brackets
print("This function prints whatever is in the brackets")
print("This function can also print numbers like so: ")
print(12)
