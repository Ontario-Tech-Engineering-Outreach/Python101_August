# Arrays are variables, but bigger
# Arrays store multiple values

myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4] # This array stores 4 values
groceryStore = ["Apple", "Orange", "Green Apple", "Strawberry", "Grape"] # this array represents fruits in a grocery aisle


# We can access variables in these arrays by calling their index, which is the place the place number they
# exist in the array. For example if we print the 0th index of the array, we print "Apple"
print(groceryStore[0])
