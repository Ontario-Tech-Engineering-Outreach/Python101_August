# Lists are even weirder, with arrays we had to store values of the same type
# But lists can store any data types. For example:

myInstructor = ["Khalil Balde", True, "Mechatronics Engineering", 21]

# Here I reperesented myself as a list. The 0th index is my name, the 1st index is whether I'm a student or not
# The 2nd index is what program/job I'm in, and the 3rd index is my age.

# To get values from a list is the same as how we access something in an array!
print("Say hello to: " + myInstructor[0])
