# Printing stuff is cool and all. But that just makes the computer follow a script
# Which is good enough for some programs, but there is so much more we can do!

# Computer code is powerful because it has the ability to process data
# In order to start with this, we need to learn what variables are

# Variables store values for us to use later in the code
myVariable = 24 # You create a variable by naming your variable and saying it is equal to some value
myVariable2 = 16


# We can do math with variables!
print(myVariable + myVariable2) # This will add our previous variables



# We can also do something like this for text. For example
name = "Khalil"
print("Hello! My name is " + name) # this code will greet us in the console depending on what the name variable is
